This week on Sep 1, 2019, it's been 5 years that I am lucky to work in the biggest IT company in the world. The dream company in which I finally joined at 25 years old.

Luck doesn't come from 5 years back. That luck started in 2004 -- 15 years ago when I was 15 years old. I started to go to Technical High School. This luck led me to receive an offer to start my first internship 2 or 3 months at the Data Processing Laboratory of Colégio Bagozzi, right after starting my technical course. I was a hard-working student with a high desire to learn. I studied in the morning, did an internship in the afternoon, and a technical course at night. Leaving home every day around 6:30 AM and returning around 11:30 PM. The internship was like any other, I did everything in the laboratory, kept all machines running fine, helped students, building computers all day, adding and removing parts, installed operating systems, Windows NT/98/2000/ME/Linux, email servers and other things to keep the High School running. There was still time to create some software in VB 4/6 and Delphi for friends' pizzeria! Thanks, @Sergio Otacilio, first boss, longtime friend, first mentor. My luck here was to find you.

But this was a private school and not everyone is as lucky as I was (privilege). What a piece of luck, the luck was having my parents, working exhaustively, where it probably isn't where they wanted to be and stressing out every day to make money to keep the house and give me a good education. Probably the same luck that made my mother finish college, where she couldn't buy sweet popcorn in the break, hungry, coming alone on the bus at night in fear (yes, Brazil is dangerous), or I wouldn't have that future. Or even the same luck that my father had, working on the other people farm since he was 9 years old, and despite the stress, remaining strong in other jobs, because he had to support the family, taking care of me while my mother was in college. I have always been so happy, and I hope my parents know how much I admire and am grateful to them, even though I don't know how to express feelings. That is the greatest luck of my life, being born with these parents. I love you SO much.

I worked there for 2 years, and when I was 17, I asked to leave my internship to dedicate myself to Senior year so I could focus on the study to join in a good college and ensure that I would have the future I wanted. I continued the technical high school course and the Senior year in parallel finishing both, luckily, this was a great victory!

I joined Positivo University, where I had great teachers, not only with a huge technical knowledge but who were great at directing me to the right side. On my first day in college, teachers asked what I would like to do and what my plan was, and I promptly replied "I want to work at Microsoft."

I thought I would finish my Information Systems major in 4 years, but the story was much longer than that. When I started college, in the first month, I got a software engineer internship as a C # and VB.NET developer (Framework 1.1 and 2.0) at ESAT. Thankfully since I had to pay for college. Here I had two people to thank, @Rogerio Cordeiro, who has always been a mentor and inspiration for me. He encouraged me to join Microsoft and he was who put me in contact with @Diego Neufert, my second mentor and manager, who gave me the opportunity and who taught me a lot for the next few years. I have a lot of respect for you and I will never forget what you have taught me and still teach me today. You both were my second luck. Thank you.

In that same company, I was also fortunate to meet two other important people who taught me all the programming base I needed and even teach today. Thank you very much @Tiago Soczek who worked with me here, and today works on my old team at Microsoft Brazil. Thanks, @Jefferson Soares, I would never have delivered some projects in VB.NET if it weren't for your teachings, it certainly contributed a lot to my career.

After some years working in the area, I went to look for new opportunities in a small company, which again had @Rogerio Cordeiro putting me in contact with the owner of the company. In this small company, but with great potential, I met my third luck, @Matheus Safraid, who taught me many things professionally and for life. We became so friends, that I am your best man, and you can bet that when I get married it will be my best man.
Although my focus from the beginning was working at Microsoft, here in this company I learned to be more agnostic about technology. Many of the things we worked on were from Microsoft and anyone who knows me knows that I was always a fan, however, I worked with several other technologies that opened my mind and made me a better professional. You are one of the greatest luck I have, a friend for life, I admire you so much. Thank you.

I came back to ESAT after some time, with a different mind, with new ideas and more mature. I took on many new responsibilities and learned much more than I imagined I could learn at the company I worked for before. This time, I was lucky again, the luck here was to have an old friend @Guilherme Karatchuk as a new boss and allowing me to show more of what I learned in my time off. He has already worked with me and was a great friend since the first time in the company. It was a giant partnership, we worked on several projects together and that certainly contributed to my growth. Thank you.
Another very important guy during this company was @Jimi Roy, friend, manager, mentor. It is part of the great ones that I admire, along with several that I have met. If anyone taught me to have a corporate stance and analytical thinking at work, it was you. Thank you very much. I don't deserve so much luck.

I never liked being in the comfort zone, and after some time it was no different, I moved to one of the companies that most changed my life for the better and that without it I would not be where I am. I started working at CINQ, one of the companies in Curitiba that I considered most innovative and I still consider it today. 3 fantastic owners @Aldir, @Edson, @Jayme who certainly live up to the company's good reputation. I have never worked in such a large team, with so much cutting-edge technology and with a high level of development. I had a lot of good opportunities, made a lot of friends, and worked on some good clients. But here I had something that besides being technical, changed my life forever. In this company, although I already knew, I saw how essential English would be if I wanted to get where I planned. Many of the people on the teams I worked with had excellent and beautiful English that made me ashamed of how I spoke. I then decided that I should do an Exchange, but I was scared and had a lot of doubts, including leaving a company that I liked so much and had so many people to learn. It was then that I was very lucky when, when going to talk to each of the owners, they instead of trying to retain me in the company and convince me to stay, supported my will, and told their own experiences. Here my greatest luck was to have heard his words @Aldir Brandão. I believe you don't remember that, but I will never forget what you said and how you encouraged me. Thank you.

With that decision, I left college and in 2011 I went to Ireland to study English. My first departure from the country, my first passion for traveling. That cold in the belly that only those who travel know, but who do not know what they will find ahead. I planned the trip for almost a year, as I had to have enough money to stay at least 6 months to finish the intensive English course. The course was every day from 08:00 to 13:30. In the first month, we lived in a family home, where I learned more than the other 6 months we stayed in the country. An enriching experience that brought me a lot of learning, maturity, and responsibility. My luck here was to have my Irish mother @Kathy who helped us from beginning to the end of this exchange even though I no longer lived at home.

During that time, I tried several interviews in the IT area, but unfortunately, I didn't get any sponsors at the time to pay for the work visa along with the job offer. The country was in crisis in 2011 and I knew it would be very difficult, even so, I did about 40 interviews in 6 months. If I had passed one, I probably wouldn't have returned to Brazil anytime soon, and that would have been a huge departure from my career plan to join Microsoft, but I was very happy there and it certainly wouldn't have been bad. But at that time I was not just studying, on the contrary, I tried to apply many of the software ideas to build my startup and maybe get rich. Perhaps due to lack of maturity at the time or even knowledge in some areas of administration, they did not work, but I still use that learning and experience to date and certainly helped me achieve my goals.

After finishing the course and going through many adventures with some trips through which I can tell one day here, the time and money are over and the ticket back home was already scheduled.

Before returning, I had already contacted some companies in Curitiba and had some interviews scheduled. I arrived doing interviews and again luck knocked on the door and I met @Horst Hunger, a giant with a giant heart, the best manager I ever had in Curitiba, an extremely good guy at what he does, technical and with a huge soft skill to deal with people. It offered me an excellent job opportunity that would be the watershed of my career. I started working as a Software Architect / Cloud Computing at TechResult when practically nothing was said about Microsoft Azure or Amazon. I was also an ALM / DevOps consultant as in all other companies. Here, I was not only lucky, but I was also lucky. @Horst who gave me the opportunity and taught me a lot before and after this company. @Leandro Prado, whoever later you will understand the importance that has in my dream. @Daniel Oliveira, a model I have followed for a long time before joining this company because I have known him since mid-2008, where he followed a path very similar to mine and which has the career that I mirror as an example. I already worked at Microsoft when I joined the company, always helped me a lot like a career guide, an excellent mentor. Thank you, you were exceptional and essential to my growth. How lucky, my friends!

After a lot of work, professional growth, many, many customers, I left for a new company and went to be Configuration Manager at GVT, currently Vivo, hired by BRQ as a third party. This was the company that most took me out of the comfort zone of my career because no technology was Microsoft, I had to learn a lot from scratch and try to link with my knowledge in other areas. This was another extremely important step to prove to myself that I could do anything and nothing would block me. Here I worked with an excellent team, where I will never forget the challenges we encountered and managed to solve. My luck here was to have you @Wilson Bissi as coordinator and friend. Working side by side to try to improve the company's processes. @Tiago Manosso and @Alan do Espírito Santo, who taught me a lot how to work with such different profiles and still be able to deal with the challenges of everyday life. You are friends for life, always count on me.

Up to that point, you may have wondered about my college, which was a key point and mandatory requirement for joining Microsoft. Yes, I wasn't finished yet, I came back from where I left off after returning from Ireland, but I still had a good way to go, since I didn't give the focus I should have, failing some subjects, missing some classes to focus on lectures, training that I ministered or work. I ended up only here, during that company, and it was extremely rewarding to have a degree, despite being a clear example that it doesn't count for more than practical experience. At my graduation, which would take place after the next part of the story, another phase was over and my teachers made a point of remembering that one of the students was working at Microsoft. In addition to a huge honor, I am very happy to have been remembered.

Thank you, @Marcelo Szostak, for being my advisor, teacher, and friend for so many years. You made me understand why focusing on college is so important, and as arrogant as I was, thinking that I didn't need to be in college to do my job, you were patient and did everything you could to help me achieve that goal. I was very lucky to find you on that path.

I decided it was time to try to join Microsoft. I had already finished college and would only have to do my degree. It was ready.

Remember @Leandro Prado that I talked about a while ago? He was already working at Microsoft, and since he worked with me, he told me about an open position on his team. The job was exactly my profile and what we did together at the company and I was sure this was my opportunity. I applied for this position and he referred me to the manager. The vacancy was for São Paulo, but I always knew that I would have this change, for the second time, leaving the city where I had most of my family and friends. I owe you a lot for remembering me and the dream I always had. Thanks, @Leandro for being my gateway to my dream, for being the greatest of luck, for being a friend and colleague for all these years working together. I will never forget what you did for me, and I will always be here when you need me.

I was interviewed with one of the people I came to respect the most in the coming years, the best mentor I had at Microsoft Brazil, an excellent guy to work with, @Fernando Filiputti, who directed and helped me many times, taught and was someone I could count on for help. I don't even need to say how lucky I am that you came into my life. Thank you.

This interview was a mix of nervousness, anxiety, joy, and everything else you can imagine when you are close to achieving a dream. I was in my bed, sitting, sweating, prepared for the questions to come, it was a remote interview since I wouldn't have to go to São Paulo for her. I just did not imagine that I would have two and a half hours (2:30) of the interview with the most varied questions, extremely technical, and who did not give room to escape. He left the interview without knowing if he had succeeded, although he was happy to be able to answer some key questions. I worked all my life with what I needed in the vacancy, always study to know the latest news and details of the tool and applied processes, even so, we are not talking about a small company, but the largest IT company in the world!

After that, I also did a minor interview with the vacancy manager, so she could see my profile.

Finally, after some time, I received the news that I had passed and received the offer to move to São Paulo.

That was the way to Microsoft, after that, I have a whole life inside the company. Things that I would never live in a smaller company. I was PFE (Premier Field Engineer) of TFS / DevOps for about 3 years. I moved from Curitiba to São Paulo, then I moved to Rio de Janeiro, I moved to São Paulo again. I have worked with many clients, so many that it is difficult to count, I wrote a book, made many presentations and met many, but many people of which I am proud and happy to be so lucky. I have many good stories and experiences that I would like all my friends to have these growth opportunities.

My most recent move was the plan to change countries. In summary, to understand the difficulty of the process, even though I was already working at the company, I applied for more than 30 different vacancies in more than 12 countries. My goal has always been the USA since I was a child, but my focus here was on my career to keep moving, to experience daily international work, to evolve, so the country was not important but the vacancy. After a while, @Rodrigo Gallazzi was my luck that allowed me to be here. I worked with him before leaving my current team and I always admired him for his technical skills. You know I can't thank you for what you did for me, despite your giant humility, thinking you didn't do anything. Thank you. You will always have my respect.
He told me about my vacancy, directed me, gave me extremely important tips. I applied for the vacancy, did the technical interviews with whom I considered a reference in the company, with 20 years working for Microsoft, with the vacancy manager, and passed. I received my offer, with great joy, after a lot of work, processes, goodbyes, we got it.

Today, I am living an even bigger dream, the dream of dreams, I am living in the USA, working as a Support Escalation Engineer for DevOps (Azure DevOps Server and Services), serving customers from all over the world. I made my 5 years of Microsoft, and that is just the beginning. Here is my home, my place, and my dream. My next career step is already planned, but I still want to achieve some other goals. My ways have changed a few times during my plan, but none have been bad. Several times I took a step back to take two, three, four forward. And so I keep going until I find out what my life goal is. But one thing is certain, you will still hear a lot about my name, very much!

And you know whats is most cool? I have a companion, who since the beginning of history, there sometime before going to Ireland, who accompanied me throughout this journey and will continue to accompany me throughout my life, I hope. My girlfriend, girlfriend, wife, my life and my best luck in the same place as my parents, @Gabi, Thanks! I love you!

When you look at someone and think that person is lucky, ask them and you may be surprised at how lucky they are in life. Lucky to have people around who can help, lucky for opportunities, lucky to have privileges that others, unfortunately, do not have, such as family support, education, food, etc. And above all, luck comes with effort and dedication. If you are lucky in life and do not know how to enjoy it, you will remain the same, in the comfort zone, and you will never have the luck you want. If you still think this is a lucky story, you didn't get my message, read it again!

Friends who were not explicitly thankful can bet that I remember everyone who went through my journey and helped me. I would spend a whole day putting the names one by one here, but just as I told almost nothing of the complete story, I did not mention everyone important to my career and my life. Thanks to everyone who somehow contributed or went through my journey.

I hope my story can motivate someone, as all my fortunes motivated me. Count on me if you need someone to help in any way.
Thank you if you got here! I published this story for you to get to know me and I will probably publish things related to career and subjects that can help other people. If you want to know more, feel free to get in touch!

Please, I would like to hear your feedback, I want to improve and for that, I need to know-how.

See you soon!
