Hello everyone, I'm Luiz Macedo - a proud father, loving husband, and passionate tech and creative professional.

My day job? I'm a Content Developer at Microsoft and co-founder of an exciting startup called [WillTrustYou.com](https://www.willtrustyou.com/). My workdays are filled with problem-solving, innovating, and learning - activities I love and thrive in.

I started working in tech when I was just 15 years old, developing in VB6 and Delphi and administering infrastructure environment for my High School. I've had many jobs as a developer, configuration manager, solution and software architect, and roles related to DevOps.

When I was 25, I joined Microsoft Brazil as a Premier Field Engineer. In 2018 I moved to Texas as a DevOps Support Engineer at Microsoft Corp. It was the company and country I'd always wanted, and I'm happy to work with brilliant people. I helped our customers solve tricky problems with Azure DevOps, GitHub, and other Microsoft products.
Today, I'm helping make educational content for Microsoft Learn and am in charge of the AZ-400 content, DevOps VTD, and other DevOps-related topics.

In 2023, I co-founded [WillTrustYou.com](https://www.willtrustyou.com/). Our company helps people create their digital legacy on the internet safely and simply. It is a digital asset management cloud-native platform backed by Microsoft and blockchain technologies.

I like sharing what I know and what I've done with others. That's why I started this blog. Here, I write about DevOps, SRE, Platform Engineering, Cloud Computing, Development, tips for your career, and more. I want to help other developers and professionals learn and grow in their careers.

When not studying, coding, or writing, I like playing video games, traveling, and watching Anime and TV Shows. My favorite shows are Breaking Bad, Stranger Things, and Lost. I enjoy reading books about fantasy, business, psychology, and science fiction. Read 20 minutes daily, and you will see the power of consistency.

**Fun fact:** I had a Twitch channel where I played games, and for each new follower, I imitated a pig screaming sound and loud, and I have a tattoo of a pig in cartoon style. Yes, I really like pigs.

Opinions are my own.

Thanks for reading about me. I hope you liked it and got to know me better.

Have a nice day!

Luiz
